  19 with a whole lot of nothing going on. i like animals and music and taking big licks of my oversized lollipop
</p>

  as for ponytown, don't be afraid of me! my only ask is to have common decency. too many people are cruel online.
</p>
<p align="center">
  some basic stuffs: i do art: digital/traditional illustration and clay sculpting! i'm also physically disabled + audhd, keep these in mind when interacting with me longterm. i'm not always available due to simply feeling Awful (i am so sorry) i promise i am not quiet nor shy, just doing something else probably!
</p>
<p align="center">
  i have many interests, but most of them focus on art. majority of my attention is on ocs specifically, but outside of that, i love exploring symbolism, character thought processes, and animated movies as a whole :) as for less involved interests, i enjoy circus works, anything vintage, and psychology.

  i block very easily. i play ponytown to talk to like-minded people and have fun with friends.. if we were never going to talk in the first place, it don't matter! i am sociable, but by no means do i want to be friends/interact with just anyone. though, i mainly block over 3 things:
</p>
    <h6 align="center">
      1. mean-spirited, overall vindictive or aggressive 2. profic/proship or "neutral" 3. overly sexual *often* (gooner type humor/"aesthetic"..)
      </p>
      <h6 align="center">
  if any of that bothers you, i recommend you block me.. i am not looking for altercations and i will simply just mute/block and move on. do what is healthy for you :)
