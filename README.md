  <summary><b></b>PONY TOWN INFO</b></summary>
HELLO!!!! I'm usually running around on ponytown alone or with <a href="https://github.com/windch1mes">chime</a>/<a href="https://github.com/MouthHole">liv</a>/<a href="https://github.com/grubberglubber">dumaya</a> or sitting justtt slightly under spawn on 18+! i like to do bits and i accidentally end up roleplaying 90% of the time, which happens to usually be as a monkey, even though i am terrified of them. anyway this stuff is lighthearted and probably the stupidest shit ever
</p>
i really enjoy talking to people on PT, please don't be frightened by me or friends!!! i will only struggle if i can't meet your energy HAHA
</p>
  basic stuff like c+h is cool! i'm A-OKAY with inspiration from my ponies but please don't go out and fully copy OCs. not like i'm gonna hunt you down but Man will i be confused. cause why you got my guy in your hooves
</p>
  on the Heavier side, i will block easily if you're sexual often, straightup mean, or argue a lot in public chat. they're never too personal, if at all, but i don't wish to see stuff like this while playing. sometimes these blocks are just me being mildly uncomfortable with the topic or tone and mean nothing else. although social, i'm very picky with those i'll go up to on my own.
</p>
    other than all that, i don't take PT too seriously! it's just another chatroom online! i'm on often as i'm physically disabled/chronically ill and value talking to people outside of my usual circle, so feel free to say hi :) i've got much to say. Most of the time atleast..

<summary>ABOUT ME</summary>
  <p>you wanna know about lil ol me? aw shucks</p>
    <p>WELL TRULY! i do not know what to say! (is going to say things) i'm physically disabled, plus audhd! there's a lot of comorbidities here, but my biggest problems are inattention and fatigue. that may make me seem a bit disinterested at times, but i promise it's not</p>
     <p>as for labels, i'm queer, but aroace and genderfluid/nonbinary fit best.</p>
  <p>my favorite color is orange and i like oversharing online....... hmmmmmm.... what else what else. i don't take mean-spirited jokes about a harmless person lightly. the internet has convinced some people it's okay to be mean. i fully accept being sensitive and there is nothing you can do about it</p>
   <p>i have had a crazy life at my ripe age of 19 and you are bound to learn about it if we talk about experiences</p>
