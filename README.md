  <summary><b></b>PONY TOWN INFO ----- ⭐</b></summary>
HELLO!!!! I'm usually running around on ponytown alone or with <a href="https://github.com/MouthHole">liv</a>/<a href="https://github.com/grubberglubber">dumaya</a>. i'm not on as much anymore and may miss a lot if i am on.... but i really enjoy talking to people on PT, please don't be frightened by me or friends!!! i will only struggle if i can't meet your energy. i mostly like talking about art in any form
</p>
  on the Heavier side, i will block easily if you're sexual often, straightup mean, or argue a lot in public chat. they're never too personal, if at all, but i don't wish to see stuff like this while playing. sometimes these blocks are just me being mildly uncomfortable with the topic or tone and mean nothing else. although social, i'm very picky with those i'll go up to on my own. please remember i am a young adult. sometimes i play on safe just to wander and look at pretty ponies- but i am not looking for any longterm friends there. i'm okay with passing conversation :-)
</p>
    other than all that, i don't take PT too seriously! feel free to say hi :) i've got much to say, usually

<summary>ABOUT ME ----- ⭐</summary>
  <p>you wanna know about lil ol me? aw shucks</p>
    <p>WELL TRULY! i do not know what to say! (is going to say things) i'm physically disabled, plus audhd! my biggest problems are inattention and fatigue. that may make me seem a bit disinterested at times, but i promise it's not on purpose :'). i have scoliosis and very most likely hEDS. hEDS causes many other issues aside from being a "joint" disorder, so i ask of you to stay patient with me if i seem a little off. my body likes to fight me and it Wins</p>
     <p>as for labels, i'm queer if that is not oh so painfully obvious</p>
  <p>my favorite color is orange and i like oversharing online....... hmmmmmm.... what else what else. i don't take mean-spirited jokes about a harmless person lightly. the internet has convinced some people it's okay to be mean. i fully accept being sensitive and there is nothing you can do about it</p>
   <p>i have had a crazy life at my ripe age of 19 and you are bound to learn about it if we talk about experiences</p>
  <p>i have two cats. one had FIP and nearly died in my arms last year. i paid for his medicine over facebook black market because it was not FDA approved and he's okay now! i stole my other cat from my neglectful neighbors this october and she got an abortion! i like to hear about pets. tell me about em</p>
