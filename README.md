hello! if you're here, you're most likely from Pony Town
<p align="center">
My name is <b>RORY</b>, I'm a 19 y/o artist.
My carrd has more about me

  <center><summary>PONY TOWN INFO</summary></center>
  <p><center>I'm usually with friends on PT, or with the Dungeon Meshi fandom on 18+, who happen to overlap basically 100%. I'm open to making new friends, so feel free to pester me! I recognize people usually by whatever pony I met them as first, so forgive me if I'm blind as hell.</center></p>
  <p>I try to be as friendly as possible and talk to whoever I find interesting! I tend to talk to a lot of people on there now, so keeping up with multiple conversations at once has become very hard. I don't mean to ignore anyone :') I also sit off-tab often. Not sure why, if I'm being honest.</p>
  <p>I don't really have a BYI or DNI thing other people have. As long as you're respectful I don't have an issue with you. I hold very progressive beliefs, so if that's something you're against, I guess it just wasn't meant to be. I will hide/block if I'm uncomfortable regardless, though, especially if you're proship/profiction. If you enjoy stuff like that in a fictional world, I don't want to imagine what kind of person you are in the real one. I'm all for stories with heavy topics, THAT is not that.<p>
  <p>On a similar note, although I'm 19, I will try to steer away from any NSFW related topics. I'm okay with one-off jokes and the what, but otherwise, I will just not engage in it if it continues. If you're a friend over 18 reading this, that doesn't apply, go ahead and be freaks. Anyway, I don't mean to be a priss, it's just not something I necessarily like to talk about. I won't hide or block for that unless it keeps being targetted towards me or a friend who dislikes it.</p>
  <p>Either way, I am not one to make a big deal of something, and writing this out has made me feel very online! I don't know how to feel about that!</p>
